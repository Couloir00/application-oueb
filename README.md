### Comments about the code
- When we enter a city for the first time after a blank search we have to refresh the page and then click on the button "Events near my city" for the filter to work.
- The city you entered last is stored but when you navigate and click to see another artist's events then even if the city name is written inside the search bar all the events will be shown. You have to click on the "Events near me" button for the filter to be applied. 
- I am aware that there is a big white space on top of all my pages and I don't know why. I'd like to get rid of it. 
- I am working on these little problems.
